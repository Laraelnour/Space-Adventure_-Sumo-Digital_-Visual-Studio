# Space-Adventure_-Sumo-Digital_-Visual-Studio
A Simple game where a rocket takes down saucers using a laser.
This game was developed as part of a series of C++ Workshops hosted by Sumo Digital.
All Audio, Sprites, Background, and Additional files are property of Sumo Digital.

The Code of the .cpp file was written by Lara Abouelnour under the supervision of the workshop volunteers.
A creative, personal version was derived from this project and is available on my profile under the name 'Marceline-Vs-Ghosts-VisualStudio'.

Unfortunately, the files were too many to include on GitHub, however feel free to checkout the 'Space Adventure.mp4' video attached instead. 
Do not hesistate to contact me if you wish to be sent the files.


Thank you,
Lara Abouelnour
